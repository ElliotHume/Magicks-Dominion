Magicks Dominion is a top-down strategy game that is based around resource management, battle strategy, and casting magick rituals.
The players' characters are prophets of nature gods from different beliefs, the egyptian god Geb, and the roman god Silvanus. The players are trying to conquer back land stolen from their deity.



The game is __very__ early in development and currently only the basic features/mechanics are being developed currently.

Below is a picture of the board when the game begins. The player will select which tiles they would like to start their conquest from. Information about the tiles is displayed on the menu in the top left, player information is displayed on the menu in the top right.
